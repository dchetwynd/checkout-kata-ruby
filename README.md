This is my attempt at implementing the Checkout Kata (http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html) in Ruby.
To run the tests,  the rspec  testing framework will first need to be installed on your machine.

This code was started at a meeting of the Manchester CodeJo group (http://www.manchester-codejo.com/)
